## General Information
- Medicle is a static, client-side only web application built on vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS.
- Medicle was built to function almost identically to the popular game Wordle.
- Wordle is a web-based word game. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. Wordle has a single daily solution, with all players attempting to guess the same word.
- Medicle relies on the same concept but rather than using any five-letter word the potential answers are medical acronyms (specifically medical acronyms recognised by the HSE in Ireland).
- The purpose of Medicle is to allow medical professionals or students to practice their knowledge of the acronyms they need to know in a fun and challenging game.
